## Client-Server Chat System
Overview
This project implements a client-server chat system in Python using TCP sockets. The system allows multiple clients to connect to a central server, exchange messages, and engage in real-time communication. The server facilitates the routing of messages between clients and manages the connection state.

## Features
Client-Server Architecture: Utilizes a client-server model where clients connect to a central server to exchange messages.
Real-Time Communication: Enables real-time messaging between connected clients, facilitating instant communication.
Connection Management: Manages client connections, assigns unique usernames, and maintains a list of connected clients and servers.
Round-Trip Time (RTT) Measurement: Measures the Round-Trip Time (RTT) between clients and servers to optimize communication latency.
Chat Interface: Provides a simple command-line interface for clients to initiate chats, send messages, and close conversations.
Scalability: Designed with scalability in mind to handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently.
Error Handling: Implements robust error handling to ensure graceful recovery from network errors and exceptions.
Installation
